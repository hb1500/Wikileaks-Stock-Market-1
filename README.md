# Predicting exchange rate change with diplomacy cables

- This project's objective is to measure how confidential information affects the financial market. We know that market efficiency is based on the assumption that all market participants have fair access to the market. More importantly, it includes any kind of information. However, people do possess confidential information in the real world. Most financial markets have prohibited any kind of inside trading. Because of the difficulties to access confidential data, detecting the influence of confidential information affect market is hard. 

- Luckily, we now have [Public Library of US Diplomacy](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/about/) dataset. We scraped documents from 2000 to 2010. With the scrapped data, we built models to detect if we can predict the abnormal change of the exchange rate in different countries. The historical exchange rate is fetched from CRSP datasets and this dataset covers 21 countries, which are Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom and Venezuela. 

## Data set

We have two datasets: Public library of US diplomcy and the exchange rate dataset crapped from CRSP. 
For the purpose of error analysis, we split data by country and year. You can access data through the links below.

## Build the regression and classfication model
To build the Random Forest Regression Model: 
1. Change working directory to the directory of `RanFrst_regres.py`. 
2. Run the python script as follwoing instructions:

### if user is interested in classifier function in juypter notebook, we have the following two examples
- `All_Countries_Neg_AUC_May17th.ipynb`	: Do the classification and AUC plot
- `Feature_Importance_All_Columns.ipynb`: finding out the feature importance 


#### searching the file name was written in hard code. So, if you want to rename the data, you would need to modify the main function.
- For example, the folder of Country by Country and Year by Year 

### run random forest classifier 
```
python RanFrst_classfy.py 10 ./data_country/ country_10 -country
```
```
python RanFrst_regres.py 10 ./data_year/ country_10 -year
```
Here, the pararmeters:
> - `10`: the number of estimators in random forest model
> - `./data_country/`: input data path, supposed data is stored under `./data_country/`
> - `country_10`: output data path, it would automaticall create a directory called `./output_country_10/`
> - `-country`: let the model know it is searching what kind of data (country level or year)
> - `-year`: let the model know it is searching what kind of data (country level or year)

- Year by Year
### run random forest classifier regression
```
python RanFrst_regres.py 10 ./data_country/ year_10 -all
```
```
python RanFrst_classfy.py 10 ./data_year/ year_10 -all
```
> - `10`: the number of estimators in random forest model
> - `./data_year/`: input data path, supposed data is stored under `./data_year/`
> - `year_10`: output data path, it would automaticall create a directory called `./output_year_10/`
> - `-all`: means run all feature functions with text, exchange rate and mix features. `-text`, `-price` and `-mix` only run the functions. This can help speed up the time computation.

## Result - regression
`RanFrst_regres.py` would automatically generate output under the user defined output directory, ex `./output_country_10/` or `./output_year_10/`. 
- Country by Country
It would generate 22 files named by the country name, ex: the input `final_Single_mexico` file would generate file `mexico` with 
> - mse: mean square error
> - mae: mean absolute error
> - median_absolute_error: median absolute error
> - r2: r squre score
> - (2086, 5): total 2086 instances with 5 features. (it's the size of input dataframe)

(2086, 5)

- Year by Year
It would generate 10 files named by the year. ex. the input 2003 files would generate `2003` with 
> - mse: mean square error
> - mae: mean absolute error
> - median_absolute_error: median absolute error
> - r2: r squre score
> - (1233, 5): total 1233 instances with 5 features. (it's the size of input dataframe)

## Output - classify

`RanFrst_classfy.py` would automatically generate output under the user defined output directory, ex `./output_country_10/` or `./output_year_10/`. What's more, it would automatically create a folder and store three generated AUC figures.
- Country by Country
It would generate 22 files named by the country name, ex: the input `final_Single_australia` file would generate file `australia` with the following table, 
> - fpr: increasing false positive. in this example only has one treshold
> - tpr: increasing true positive. in this example only has one treshold
> - roc_auc: increasing accuracy, computing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC)
