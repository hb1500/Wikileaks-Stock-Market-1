       "' \\n1.  (C) Summary.  According to Taiwan\\'s Mainland Affairs \\nCouncil (MAC), Beijing this afternoon, January 13,  accepted \\nTaiwan\\'s proposed delegation to participate in negotiations \\non direct cross-Strait charter flights around the Chinese New \\nYear.  At this still early point in the negotiation process, \\nboth sides have actually made small concessions -- Beijing by \\napparently accepting the presence of Taiwan government \\naviation officials in the Taiwan delegation, and Taiwan by \\npulling back from its adamant insistence that Taiwanese \\nofficials responsible for cross-Strait relations be included \\nin the Taiwan delegation.  In the face of growing Taiwan \\npublic hopes for a charter flight deal in time for the \\nChinese New Year, and of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) \\ndemonstration that its delegation to Beijing successfully \\nworked out arrangements for charter flights, the DPP \\ngovernment had been forced to accept Beijing and the KMT\\'s \\nagenda, and received a small concession from the PRC in \\nreturn.  End Summary. \\n \\nTaiwan Twice Responds \\n--------------------- \\n \\n2.  (C) Taiwan twice responded to the PRC Taiwan Affairs \\nOffice (TAO) call for what Taiwan calls the \"second round\" of \\nnegotiations, the \"first round\" being a meeting in Macao last \\nFriday, January 7, that MAC Chairman Joseph Wu insisted to \\nAIT had been \"very successful\" in setting the framework for \\nfurther negotiations.  Chen Chung-hsin, Counselor responsible \\nfor cross-strait relations at the National Security Council \\n(NSC), told AIT on January 11, that the government had \\nauthorized Taipei Airline Association (TAA) Director Michael \\nLo (Lo Ta-hsin) to transmit a proposed Taiwan five-person \\ndelegation list to Beijing consisting of:  TAA Director \\nMichael Lo, another airline industry representative, the \\nChief of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA, under the \\nCommunication and Transportation Ministry), and one official \\neach from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Straits \\nExchange Foundation (SEF).  Explaining that he is a \\n\"pragmatist\" who just wants to get charter flights moving, \\nChen said he had cautioned his \"colleagues\" that the MAC and \\nSEF officials would be automatically rejected by TAO.  That, \\nhe noted, is exactly what happened, as the TAO spokesman \\nannounced in a press conference in Beijing yesterday, January \\n12. \\n \\n3.  (C) That same afternoon, Chen said, the Taiwan government \\nworked out a new delegation list consisting of Michael Lo, \\nCAA Director Chang Kuo-cheng, one CAA staffer, and Mr. Lo\\'s \\nChief Secretary, which NSC Secretary-General Chiou I-jen \\napproved and which Michael Lo transmitted to his PRC CAA \\ncounterpart in Beijing.  Chen felt reasonably confident that \\nthis second list would be acceptable to Beijing, because, he \\nsaid, the TAO spokesman in Beijing had replied to a \\nreporter,s query on whether all Taiwan government officials \\nwould be unacceptable to Beijing by clarifying that he had \\nonly mentioned MAC and SEF. \\n \\n4.  (C) This afternoon, January 13, Joseph Wu called AIT to \\nsay that Taiwan had just received a positive response from \\nBeijing, accepting Taiwan\\'s revised delegation proposal. \\nShortly afterward, NSC Counselor Chen called to convey the \\nsame messagae, clearly delighted by the outcome and proud of \\nhis part in it.  The Taiwan side, Wu told AIT, had made one \\nlast ditch effort to get a MAC economist included in the \\ndelegation, but Beijing had refused.  Wu stated the two sides \\nare working out the details of meeting time and place, which \\nhe hopes will take place this weekend.  Final details will be \\nannounced at a government-wide -- MAC, NSC, MND, and Ministry \\nof Transport and Communications -- press conference tomorrow \\nafternoon, January 14, at 5:00 p.m. \\n \\nWay Forward \\n----------- \\n \\n5.  (C) In his meeting with AIT, Chen appeared more flexible \\non the issue of Taiwan government participation in charter \\nflight negotiations than MAC Chair Joseph Wu.  In public and \\nto AIT in private, Wu has continued to insist that Taiwan \\nwill only negotiate with China on charter flights according \\nto the \"Hong Kong model\" (the 2002 air service agreement \\nbetween Hong Kong and Taiwan by delegations nominally headed \\nby airline industry officials, but with all substantive \\nnegotiations done by government officials from both sides). \\nChen, however, supported revision of the proposed Taiwan \\ndelegation list, explaining to AIT that the \"Hong Kong model\" \\ncould be used for subsequent expanded cross-strait air \\nservice negotiations.  President Chen, he told AIT, had \\napproved of this graduated negotiation process, the third \\nstage of which would be negotiation on the \"three links\" \\n(commodity, transport, and post).   At the present stage, he \\nexplained, charter flights are the \"critical key\" on which \\nfuture progress depends.  First, he said, we must reduce \\ncross-Strait tensions. \\n \\n6.  (C) Chen told AIT that the DPP government was having to \\ntread very carefully on the cross-Strait issue, as many of \\nits supporters were hostile to any concessions on \\nnegotiations with China.  \"Liberty Times,\" he noted, \\nrepresented that contingent and functioned as a major \\nrestraint on the Government,s freedom of action.  Chen, \\nhowever, was just as dismissive of the KMT delegation to \\nBeijing as Joseph Wu and other DPP leaders.  The KMT trip, \\nChen charged bitterly, constituted Chinese government \\nintervention to help the KMT, which allowed itself to be used \\nby China.  He was particularly incensed at the claims by the \\nKMT that the charter flight issue had been resolved by the \\nKMT delegation to Beijing (see septel report on KMT Chairman \\nLien Chan,s meeting with the Director). \\n \\n \\nComment \\n------ \\n \\n7.  (C) The charter flight issue is playing out against the \\nbackdrop of  Taiwan,s bitter post-elections politics in the \\nrun up to the formation of the new government (i.e., \\nExecutive Yuan).  The KMT delegation visit to Beijing and \\nsubsequent KMT claims that it successfully negotiated a \\ncharter flight deal forced the Taipei government to move and \\nnecessitated the Taiwan government\\'s small but significant \\nback step on delegation composition.  Beijing saved Taipei \\nsome face by agreeing to two non-mainland related officials \\nin the Taiwan delegation.  This is better news than AIT is \\nused to. \\nPAAL \\n'"
